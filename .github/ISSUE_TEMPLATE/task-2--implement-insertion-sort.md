**Description**

Implement/modify the textbook insertion sort to sort `List` of items.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You are required to use the adaptive version of insertion sort, that
  has an initial bubble pass of smallest value to leftmost index, and that
  uses shifting to make a hole to insert the values.
