**Description**

Implement the shell sort algorithm to sort a `List` of item values.  You should use the code from our textbook, modified to
work on `List` types.  You need to reuse the `calculateInitialH()` function from task 3.

**Suggested Solution**


**Additional Requirements**

- You must reuse the `calculateInitialH()` function in your implementation.
- You must correctly perform h-step sorting, using insertion sorts in your code.
